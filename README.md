# A-Bugs-Life

## **Introduction**

This project simulates the movement and interaction of bugs placed on a Bug Board. Bugs move according to their behavior, and when they land on the same cell, they engage in a fight until only one bug remains.

## **Features**

1.  **Bug Board Initialization:** Start the simulation by loading bugs onto the board from an external file.
2.  **Bug Details:** Access detailed information about each bug, including ID, type, and location.
3.  **Bug Search:** Quickly find specific bugs by searching for their unique ID.
4.  **Bug Movement:** Trigger bug movements and observe their interactions in response to taps on the board.
5.  **Bug Life Histories:** Track the path and life status of every bug, witnessing their journey from start to finish.
6.  **Cell Occupancy:** Explore each cell to see which bugs are present, providing insights into their spatial distribution.
7.  **Continuous Simulation:** Experience an ongoing simulation where bugs move and interact with each other over time.
8.  **Bug Battles:** Witness bug battles as they fight for survival, influencing the dynamics of the bug population.

## **Getting Started**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Compile the source files using your preferred compiler.
3.  Run the executable to start the Bug Board Simulator.

## **Usage**

1.   Use the menu items to interact with the Bug Board Simulator.
2.   Follow on-screen instructions to navigate through the simulation.
